## About the Video Course
Learn Android App Development with Android 8.0 Oreo by building real apps including Twitter, Instagram, and Super Mario Run. Wish you'd thought of Whatsapp/ Instagram/ Google Maps? Me too. But until I work out how to build a time machine, this course is the next best thing - The Complete Android Oreo Developer Course. Kicking things up a notch from my smash-hit The Complete Android N Developer Course, my latest course is your fast-track, skip-the-queue ticket to building high-caliber Android apps. Because let's face it… you're busy. You want results. And you don't have time to hang around. Whether you're looking to usher in the next generation of smart TVs, fitness wearables, games consoles, game-changing AI, smartwatches, or you just want to build simple apps for good old-fashioned fun, Android 8.0 Oreo is your key to unbridled creativity. Its advantages include: 
•	Freedom to work from anywhere (beach, coffee shop, airport—anywhere with Wi-Fi)
•	Potential to work with forward-thinking companies (from cool start-ups to pioneering tech firms)
•	Rocket-fuelled job opportunities and powered-up career prospects
•	A sense of accomplishment as you build amazing things 
•	Make any Android app you like (your imagination is your only limit)
